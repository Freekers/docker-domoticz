# stoorren/docker-domoticz

This is a fork of freekers/docker-domoticz with personal customizations: switch base image back to demydiuk/domoticz:latest and include zigbee2mqtt plugin.

The images are rebuild whenever the base image is updated on Docker Hub (i.e. demydiuk/domoticz).

## Tags

The `latest` tag provides the latest beta version, which is considered under development and thus caution must be exercised when using it.

| Tag | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| latest | Latest beta version. |

## Usage

```
docker run -d \
  --name=domoticz \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e WEBROOT=domoticz `#optional` \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 6144:6144 \
  -p 1443:1443 \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  --device <path to device>:<path to device> \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  stoorren/docker-domoticz
```

## Docker-Compose

```
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  domoticz:
    image: stoorren/docker-domoticz
    container_name: domoticz
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - WEBROOT=domoticz #optional
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 6144:6144
      - 1443:1443
    devices:
      - <path to device>:<path to device>
    restart: unless-stopped  
```

### Passing Through USB Devices

To get full use of Domoticz, you probably have a USB device you want to pass through. To figure out which device to pass through, you have to connect the device and look in dmesg for the device node created. Issue the command 'dmesg | tail' after you connected your device and you should see something like below.

```
usb 1-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 7 using ehci-pci
ftdi_sio 1-1.2:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
usb 1-1.2: Detected FT232RL
usb 1-1.2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```
As you can see above, the device node created is ttyUSB0. It does not say where, but it's almost always in /dev/. The correct tag for passing through this USB device is '--device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0'


## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8080` | WebUI |
| `-p 6144` | Domoticz communication port. |
| `-p 1443` | Domoticz communication port. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |
| `-e WEBROOT=domoticz` | Sets webroot to domoticz for usage with subfolder reverse proxy. Not needed unless reverse proxying. |
| `-v /config` | Where Domoticz stores config files and data. |
| `--device <path to device>` | For passing through USB devices. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

To configure Domoticz, go to the IP of your docker host on the port you configured (default 8080), and add your hardware in Setup > Hardware.
The user manual is available at [www.domoticz.com](https://www.domoticz.com)


## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it domoticz /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f domoticz`
